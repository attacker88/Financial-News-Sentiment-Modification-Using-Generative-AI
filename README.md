## Assessing Sentiment Modification in Financial  News While Preserving Text Integrity Using  Generative AI Models
In today’s media landscape, financial news can
 be highly influenced by the biases of its writers and outlets,
 potentially swinging markets and investor behavior to their
 liking. This paper introduces a focused study on the use of
 generative AI models to transfer sentiment in financial news
 while preserving the original meaning of the text. We begin
 by conducting sentiment analysis on a financial news dataset
 to identify the existing sentiment and get the polarity scores for
 each sentence. The OpenAI GPT-4o model is then employed to
 alter these sentiments—such as changing positive sentiment to
 neutral, neutral to positive, neutral to negative and negative to
 neutral using specific prompts. The modified text undergoes a
 subsequent sentiment analysis to confirm the successful transfer
 of sentiment. Finally, we compare the original and modified texts
 to ensure that the semantic integrity and meaning are maintained
 throughout the process. This study addresses the critical issue of
 sentiment manipulation in financial news, offering a method to
 examine how generative AI models can help modify sentiment
 without distorting the underlying message.The study has shown
 some good results of generative AI models in maintaining text
 integrity and also sentiment transfer. This w
